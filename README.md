# Song-Prediction 
This song prediction model is developed with the K-Nearest Neighbors machine learning model and has a mean error rate of around 16. A linear regression model was also created to compare the accuracy of the 2 models. The ipynb files are not viewable on Github and need to be downloaded to be viewed in an IDE. Newsong.py is an example of taking a song's data from Spotify's API to predict the popularity of the song.
